## Implementation

- Follow functional programming principles where possible
- Use interfaces for data structures and type definitions
- Prefer immutable data (`const`, `readonly`)
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) operators
- Avoid `any` type as much as possible
- Avoid code comments in favor of descriptive variable names

## Testing

Use `Vitest` as a testing framework.
